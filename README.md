This repository houses ongoing digital work for the Massachusetts Historical Society and the Primary Source Coop. The digital work attends to different areas of semantic data and natural language processing. Each folder contains scripts, mostly Python in Jupyter Notebooks. These folders are organized by task.

## Folder Organization

#### Named Entities
This folder has scripts for extracting named entities as well as measuring the accuracy of those results.
#### Networks
The Networks folder has scripts for building and visualizing network information.
#### Parsers
This folder contains scripts for parsing XML data and creating a dataframe of metadata and text content.
