              <p>Catharine Maria Sedgwick
                
                During her lifetime, Catharine Maria Sedgwick (1789-1867) became known in the United States as the most significant, experimental, influential, and highly regarded woman writer in the Early National period of American literature. Her novels, stories, sketches, didactic novellas, biographies, and travel books were widely read and well-reviewed, and appealed to a wide range of readers.  By the mid-1820s Sedgwick was praised as the nation's premier "authoress." Her work was also highly regarded abroad, where many of her books and a selection of her 150 short works were republished, initially in England and subsequently translated and republished in French, German, Italian, Swedish, Dutch, and Danish.
                
                In addition to writing for the public, Sedgwick was a prolific correspondent. The volume of Sedgwick's unpublished letters dwarfs her four decades of published writings. While the exact number of letters she generated is still unknown, we estimate her surviving corpus to be approximately 3,000 letters, spanning from her first surviving letter composed in the 1790s, to her final letter penned in the aftermath of the Civil War.
