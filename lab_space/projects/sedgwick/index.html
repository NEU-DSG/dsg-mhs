              <p>Catharine Maria Sedgwick
                
                During her lifetime, Catharine Maria Sedgwick (1789-1867) became known in the United States as the most significant, experimental, influential, and highly regarded woman writer in the Early National period of American literature. Her novels, stories, sketches, didactic novellas, biographies, and travel books were widely read and well-reviewed, and appealed to a wide range of readers.  By the mid-1820s Sedgwick was praised as the nation's premier "authoress." Her work was also highly regarded abroad, where many of her books and a selection of her 150 short works were republished, initially in England and subsequently translated and republished in French, German, Italian, Swedish, Dutch, and Danish.
                
                In addition to writing for the public, Sedgwick was a prolific correspondent. The volume of Sedgwick's unpublished letters dwarfs her four decades of published writings. While the exact number of letters she generated is still unknown, we estimate her surviving corpus to be approximately 3,000 letters, spanning from her first surviving letter composed in the 1790s, to her final letter penned in the aftermath of the Civil War. 
                
                The CMSOL Project
                
                The Catharine Maria Sedgwick Online Letters (CMSOL) project makes freely available authoritative transcriptions of all surviving letters written by Sedgwick during her nearly seven decades as an active correspondent. 
                
                Our digital edition provides letters in their entirety, chronologically arranged. Additionally, we provide extensive contextual notes for historical events, literary references, and personal relationships mentioned in each letter, and we tag and provide biographical information (where available) for each individual Sedgwick mentions.
                
                Our online materials are fully searchable by word and by subject. We reflect the content of each letter with multiple subject headings, including topics ranging from Authorship, Arts, and Literature & History to Gender Roles, Pregnancy & Childbirth, and Clothing & Fashion to Immigration, Reform Movements, Religion, and Travel.  Thus, our annotated transcriptions will make Sedgwick’s fascinating and informative correspondence useful on multiple levels. 
                
                Audience
                
                Our target audience is broad, including general readers, secondary through post-doctoral students, and scholars and teachers. For teachers: We hope that our edition will stimulate the inclusion of Sedgwick’s published and unpublished writings in secondary school American history and literature classrooms. 
                For scholars: Publications over the past few decades reveal that Sedgwick’s letters have been valuable for researchers and cited in fields as diverse as history, literature, American studies, women’s and gender studies, legal studies, geography, philosophy, religion, medicine, rhetoric and composition, and political science.
                
                Goals
                
                The overarching purpose of the Catharine Maria Sedgwick Online Letters edition is to promote, support, and enrich interdisciplinary research on Sedgwick and her era. Moreover, by thoroughly and accurately presenting Sedgwick’s life and work, we hope to reveal her importance as a published author, an engaged citizen, and a public intellectual, thereby contributing to the ongoing revision of U.S. literary and cultural history.
