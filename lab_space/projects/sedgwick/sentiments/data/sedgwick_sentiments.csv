I think you cannot have made any definitive determination, in relation to her -- If you had, I should have known it; should I not? I judge you by myself, for I shall never launch my barke, ‘till you lay your blessing on it -- I have been disappointed and grieved, to find my favorite and dearest friend’s character marred by vanity that has not hesitated to sacrifice integrity to its paltry gratification -- I may say, as our great Ames said “I thought she was on an elevation that no such mist would reach” -- “How is the gold become dim, and the most fine gold changed” when we consent to leave the straight onward path of virtue, for the crooked and darkened way of human folly; When we refuse to walk in the clear light of heavenly wisdom, and follow the devices of our own hearts -- I do not mean to treat E’s conduct as seriously as I may seem to. I confess that I was at first indignant that she should appropriate to herself a conquest over the noblest heart in Christendom, and sorrowful that she should violate the principles of friendship, as she did by somethings she said in relation to myself -- We neither of us, I am certain dear Robert harbor a thought or a feeling of resentment, tho’ our admiration must be abated, and our confidence limited -- -- I have most heartily rejoiced in the dawn of her happier prospects, and I have, and still do most fervently pray that she may realize the most flattering visions of hope -- -- -- Thomas W & his Sister passed a day & night with us last week -- She is a promising, tho’ I think not at present, a very interesting girl -- He was in fine spirits, and I thought much improved by a trifling abatement of his metaphysical propensities -- -- He didnot mention E’s name to me!

Frances has not been very well since she has been here -- Our Host of Children are well, and not less noisy than usual -- Robert is a charming interesting boy, and as we all agree, your image -- Little Frances has very much improved in good temper since the spring -- Did your ears burn last night dear Bob?

If Mr W has returned my best love to him. Verify your promise dear Robert and be with us soon -- My dear Brother, I am so circumscribed that even inspiration from the Genius of this place cannot on this occasion breathe through me -- Of necessity therefore my business must engross me. Will you ask Marianne & will you give her money to get six quarts of blackberries -- out of which she must boil all the juice clear and when she has strained it -- add one pound of powder Sugar to each pint of juice -- and boil it to a jelly -- this is so very useful that I wish it not to be neglected -- If the blackberries are gone Marianne must send by you some sugar to me.

She is certainly seriously out of health, but I beleive it is almost entirely the consequence of her mode of living.

How knows the gentle timid dove, To find its fond & faithful love; The sweet light-loving Lark to rise, As soon as morn unveils the skies; Or Philomel at evening hour, To seek the lone and silent bow’r? Or how the breathing blushing rose, Her fragrant bosom to unclose, To meet, the Sun’s warm genial pow’r, Or lave her in the dewey show’r? Or how the lilly’s slender stem, To bend its bright and snowy gem, In matchless loveliness beside, The meadow’s little silv'ry tide? Tis Sympathy by bounteous Heav'n, To ev’ry mode of being giv'n: That draws each to its destined goal, As if by one informing soul: ‘Twas this the little Frances drew, To fix her artless eyes on you; ‘Twas sympathy of youth & charms, That first impelled her to your arms: And Innocence almost divine, That gave her cherub lip to thine ‘Twas sweet benevolence that prest, Her guileless bosom to your breast, Whose answering purity my fair, Had almost held her ever there -- Now my dear Sister if the pleasure this little offering of Miss T muse, imparted to me was produced by my interest in the incident, or by my vanity, and not from any intrinsic merit it possesses, I beg you will not let your Husband laugh at it, I am bound by all the laws of honor and gratitude to protect its reputation. He may laugh at me as much as he pleases, but he must not point the shafts of ridicule at poor Miss Thompson, who has not vanity (which I have) as a coat of Mail to repel them -- By rights my dear Frances you should be President of the Synod, for you certainly extend your patronage to the whole body of presbyterian divinity -- Your protegé shall be attended to -- I will remember to forget that I heard him preach once, and go to hear him again -- Theodore will call upon him, and if he has a wife Sue will pay her respects to her Thank my dear Bob for his last letter, I will answer it shortly -- You will absolutely get a horror of my folios, so with love to my dear Brother I will bid you good night Yours most affly C M Sedgwick ",0.10909934221622533

It is replete with that tenderness, which animates, and softens all my Sister's feelings; and renders her in the estimation of her Friend the most excellent of human beings. I am conscious that to your enthusiasm I am indebted for the partiality you express for me, to know that I am possessed of it is enough. Nature has endowed you with the warmest affections; and your own purity prevents you discovering in your friends blemishes, which to the eye of indifference are obvious. From an investigation of the general character of our sex, I think we should naturally become converts to the Mahometan religion in one essential article, Did all our flippant race lie under a sentence of condemnation, from this supposed fact, your character by proving indubitably the existence of the soul, would redeem them. I do not mean to take a round about way my dear Sister, to tell you what I think of you, and how much I love you. A pompous and artificial expression of the native feelings of my heart, do not at all suit me, I am simple born and simple bred, and simple truths simply told best become me. Thus far and thus foolishly had I written last night, when a summons from Morpheus, arrested the pen from my hand; and now I have little enough time to tell you some fine things in as concise a manner as possible. Harry has returned from Boston; as he went there precisely. He drank deep of the cup of pleasure, but left the dregs untasted. The excellent educations of our Brothers, and the force of our Father’s example, will I hope preserve them from those allurements that too often seduce the young & ardent, from the paths of virtue. From Theodore I can tell you nothing satisfactory. That he has not “told his love” I know, but I am inclined to suspect his present silence proceeds rather from the timidity of love, than from the suggestions of prudence, the latter if you knew Susan for one half day, you would agree with me in thinking he ought entirely to disregard. Fortune might soften, might remove, some of the cares ever attendant on this life, but the want of it cannot deprive them of that happiness, resulting from a connection of two beings so pure and excellent. Susan is going to New York in May, on a visit to her friend Mrs Murray; there my dear Sister will have an opportunity of seeing her, and to see her without admiring, and loving her, is impossible -- She already loves my dear Frances; and she will not suppress her inclinations. I hope you will not neglect to call upon her, she will expect it, and the acquaintance will be a circumstance of ceaseless gratifications to you both. For myself except my own immediate connexions, I love her more tenderly than all the world beside. I feel an enthusiasm in my affection, that it will never be in the power of time or accident to weaken. If I come to New York I shall bring with me her letters; they are like herself perfection -- Eliza has told me this morning, that the Doctor has nearly concluded, not to go to New York. I feel very desirous that our dear Eben should go down, since it will be a source of so much gratification to his Father. But should not you my dear Frances deem it hazardous to trust him with one of our Merchants. None of them have that tenderness which such a little creature requires, and he would have a thousand wants, that they would never consider it worth their while to gratify. Sister says she will make every effort to find a proper conveyance for him. Our Mother is so often sick and so very weak that I should not dare to leave her, unless her health mended essentially; this I cannot expect, and I am bound by every tie to devote myself to her, the remainder of her life. I am left to soothe her last afflictions, and I have certainly on merits in cheerfully, in what is properly considered, an inestimable My presence has become necessary, or when infirmity confines her room, she cannot consent to my leaving her for She sends her love to you, to Mr Watson, and the children, and says I express her thanks for your letter. The death of Captain Whitney considerably affected her, Cato told her of it very suddenly, and it has deranged her mind a little -- -- Do not my Sister allow yourself to suffer from apprehension. She ha is better than she has been at times this winter. It would be a most powerful consolation to you to be near her, but this cannot be my Sister. -- -- Our sweet little boy is perfectly well. He feels like a bird emancipated from his cage. Our spring has been so unpleasant, and our yard so full of snow, that till within a very few days been completely confined to the house. He “wonders the pretty birds won't let him catch them, for he ant going to hurt them,"" and Anty says he may catch them; but they are good little birds to sing so pretty for him”. Twenty times a day he calls me to the door to see him run up the hill, (from the cistern to the steps) and see beautiful wheelbarrow"". I can give you his words but not his animated tones and gestures. His hair brustling in the wind, his little arms extended, and his eyes sparkling with innocence and delight, altogether form a picture fit for the pencil of the finest artist. All the splendid decorations of art never move the heart like half so much, as such an object of simplicity and loveliness. . . Do not l my dear Frances let my little namesake learn to love her aunty, & tell Master Theodore, Eben says he “has two white lambs pretty as little witches pon my honor, for him.” Considering my dear Frances I began with a declaration that the mail was just leaving town, I have written a letter of tolerable length. It has all been written in less than 15 minutes and you must take it with all its faults upon its head. You may do as you think proper about buying me a frock, if I remain here all summer I shall not want one much. Present my best love to my brother and beleive me most affy yours CMS.

It requires a better disciplined character than I possess to sustain the frittering of general intercourse; and as I advance in years and progress in wisdom, my mind recoils from the frippery and folly of fashion, and my heart clings to that interchange of domestic kindness, which gives life and permanence to our affections.

How knows the gentle timid dove, To find its fond & faithful love; The sweet light-loving Lark to rise, As soon as morn unveils the skies; Or Philomel at evening hour, To seek the lone and silent bow’r? Or how the breathing blushing rose, Her fragrant bosom to unclose, To meet, the Sun’s warm genial pow’r, Or lave her in the dewey show’r? Or how the lilly’s slender stem, To bend its bright and snowy gem, In matchless loveliness beside, The meadow’s little silv'ry tide? Tis Sympathy by bounteous Heav'n, To ev’ry mode of being giv'n: That draws each to its destined goal, As if by one informing soul: ‘Twas this the little Frances drew, To fix her artless eyes on you; ‘Twas sympathy of youth & charms, That first impelled her to your arms: And Innocence almost divine, That gave her cherub lip to thine ‘Twas sweet benevolence that prest, Her guileless bosom to your breast, Whose answering purity my fair, Had almost held her ever there -- Now my dear Sister if the pleasure this little offering of Miss T muse, imparted to me was produced by my interest in the incident, or by my vanity, and not from any intrinsic merit it possesses, I beg you will not let your Husband laugh at it, I am bound by all the laws of honor and gratitude to protect its reputation. He may laugh at me as much as he pleases, but he must not point the shafts of ridicule at poor Miss Thompson, who has not vanity (which I have) as a coat of Mail to repel them -- By rights my dear Frances you should be President of the Synod, for you certainly extend your patronage to the whole body of presbyterian divinity -- Your protegé shall be attended to -- I will remember to forget that I heard him preach once, and go to hear him again -- Theodore will call upon him, and if he has a wife Sue will pay her respects to her Thank my dear Bob for his last letter, I will answer it shortly -- You will absolutely get a horror of my folios, so with love to my dear Brother I will bid you good night Yours most affly C M Sedgwick ",0.10909934221622533
