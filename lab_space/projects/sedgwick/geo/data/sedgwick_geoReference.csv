I left home with regret -- I always do -- but I think every time I feel a severer pang -- We are so few, and so dependent upon each-other that I always feel the reproach of selfishness when I seek happiness elsewhere -- Besides our domestic establishment needs all my vigilance to keep it in operation. Our Kitchen is made up of such discordant materials that I sometimes think we must throw them all into the “Barathrum” before we have any peace -- I hope you are all comfortably established in Greenwich Castle by this time -- I think of you all by day, and dream of you all by night -- I should not write you such a little bit of a letter, but my eyes are troublesome and I find writing tires them more than any thing else -- My best love to H and J. -- Susan Mrs S & the Children send a great deal of love -- Maria says if there is room enough in my letter, she wishes I would send a kiss to Uncle Robert -- Farewell my dear Brother God bless you Yours as everCMS My dear Mrs Brush -- Is there any use in my apologizing for giving you trouble? if there is I will ‘down upon my knees, and say what you please”.

Papa was so much alarmed that he says he thought she would not have survived it. I was at Eliza’s at the time & did not see her. She is certainly seriously out of health, but I beleive it is almost entirely the consequence of her mode of living. Whether the powers of digestion would be improved or restored by a change of regimen I cannot tell. I think she has much more influence over Papa than she ever had before he feels certain that she will never recover. Her wants and suffering inspire that tenderness which she has no qualities to excite -- Happy indeed is it for her my dear Robert that our excellent Father’s compassionate heart extends its sympathy & kindness to the wants of every creature within the sphere of his affections _____ I need not tell you how severe a sufferer I am by the departure of Harry -- too was very sad at the idea of going.
