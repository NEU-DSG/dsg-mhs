                      <p>About The John Quincy Adams Digital Diary
                        John Quincy Adams (JQA, 1767–1848) is one of America’s great statesmen. The oldest son of John and Abigail Adams of Quincy, Massachusetts, his distinguished career in public service spanned six decades and included roles as diplomat, secretary of state, president, and congressman. For more than 68 years, JQA kept a diary of his public and private experiences. Begun on 12 November 1779, the diary encompassed over 15,000 pages by the time the final entries were penned before Adams’ death in 1848. The resulting 51 diary volumes comprise the longest continuous record of any American of the time and provide an unparalleled resource for students, scholars, and all lovers of history. The historical value of this diary, however, lies beyond the study of one significant individual. Information gleaned from its pages can help inform broader historical discussions on topics, including gender, race, and scientific progress.
                        The John Quincy Adams Digital Diary (DJQA) makes JQA’s diary truly accessible for the first time by presenting verified and searchable transcriptions of entries alongside the manuscript page images. Enhanced access to this free resource will include keyword and personal name search ability, along with topical search features based on themes in middle and high school American history curricula.
                        Through generous support of private foundations and corporate and individual donors, 11,600 pages with verified transcriptions are now available, covering JQA’s legal, political, and diplomatic careers (1789–1817), his time as secretary of state (1817–1825), his presidency (1825–1829), and his tenure in the United States House of Representatives (1830–1848). 
                        
                        Audience and Purpose
                        The work of the DJQA project is informed by the theories and practices of the documentary editing community. The purpose of documentary editing is not just to make historical primary source material available, but to facilitate engagement with the text by providing context. This project serves to address that overarching purpose but within a new approach: incorporating an innovative context for usability via name and topical identifiers to allow for deeper use by a broader audience. As with all Adams Papers editions, the primary audience is the scholarly researcher. However, a critical secondary audience—the K-12 community—has been considered when constructing the theoretical framework for the project. The digital edition also frames the content with extensive headnotes (both a short and long form) for the chronological periods of JQA’s life, providing a synopsis of national and world events in addition to personal experiences for each period. 
                        One of our goals with this project is to create a website with rich digital tools that will become a known destination for the K-12 audience that seeks searchable primary source content on early republic and antebellum America. The K-12 community has been involved in the DJQA project since its inception. Both high school students and educators have volunteered or interned with the project to complete transcriptions of the diary. The unique research needs of the K-12 community were identified through consultation with the Massachusetts Historical Society’s Center for the Teaching of History (CTH) staff and educators in an effort to understand how to make the diaries more useful to this particular audience. From these discussions we learned that while online transcriptions address the accessibility issue for students who have difficulty reading handwritten documents, keyword searching alone cannot adequately reveal the full, rich content of historical materials like the JQA diaries.
                        
                        Motivations Behind this Transcription/Work
                        In 2016, the Adams Papers at the MHS began its first born-digital editing project: an edition of John Quincy Adams’ diary, for which we developed a new model of textual analysis. Our goal from the beginning was to present the full corpus online to make the rich content of the diary as accessible as possible to scholars, students, and teachers. JQA often recorded more than one version of his diary for the same date. He created long entries, “line-a-day” placeholder entries, and notes or draft-like entries he called “Rubbish.” The DJQA project was thus conceived in three parts. The initial work, now complete, focused on the 11,600 pages of main entries, that is, the most substantial entry JQA wrote for any given date. Most often, this meant using the long entry version; however, the line-a-day or draft entries are used when no other version exists. Ultimately, we plan to make the entire diary available online. Currently, we are working on verified transcriptions for the approximately 2,000 pages of alternate versions of diary entries that exist for some dates. Next, we will focus on the nearly 1,600 diary pages from 1779 to 1788 that were published in two print volumes in the 1980s.
