              <p>The Papers of Roger Brooke Taney, a project based at the University of West Florida in Pensacola, will digitally publish annotated transcriptions of Taney’s papers (correspondence, legal documents, etc.). Each online volume will capture a separate aspect of Taney’s life and career, including his tenure as chief justice of the United States Supreme Court (1836-64) and his family life. The first volume, which concerns the “war” with the Second Bank of the United States, has a tentative publication date of 2023.
                Taney is remembered as the author of the infamous Dred Scott decision (1857), which denied that African Americans were U.S. citizens and asserted that Congress had no power to restrict slavery in the territories. Yet Taney’s importance goes far beyond one Supreme Court case: he was a noted Maryland attorney, served as attorney general and secretary of the Treasury in the Jackson administration, and sat as chief justice during one of the most crucial periods in the economic and constitutional development of the United States. The Papers of Roger Brooke Taney aims to capture Taney’s significance through the selected editions described above. 
                The Papers of Roger Brooke Taney is designed for scholars, students, and the general public. We hope that anyone who uses the edition will gain a greater understanding of the man and his times.
