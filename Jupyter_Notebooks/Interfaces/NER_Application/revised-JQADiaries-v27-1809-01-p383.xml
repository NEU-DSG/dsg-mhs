O’Clock this morning, the Stage called for me at my house, and I took my departure— I was alone in the Sleigh— Breakfasted at Sudbury—dined at Worcester, and reached Brookfield, 64 miles from <placeName type="nerHelper-added">Boston</placeName>, just at the setting of the Sun— About 3 miles short of Brookfield, we met a Gentleman and Lady who were in a sleigh, intending to go to Worcester— But having a restive horse whom they could not make either to advance or to return, the Lady took a Seat in the Stage with me to go home— This was the only Company that I had, in the course of this day— The roads have been as fine for sleighing as I ever knew them— At the Inn at Brookfield I found company; and unexpectedly met <persRef ref="story-joseph">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Story</persRef>, the member of Congress, who is on his return home— <persRef ref="u">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Merrick</persRef> of this place, called upon us, and invited us to his house; but we both excused ourselves— I sat in conversation with M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Story untill past Midnight— Almost entirely upon the situation of public affairs— I have found a great agitation of mind every where as I came along.— Much alarm and dissatisfaction, with an expectation of strong internal commotions.</p> </div> </div> <div type="entry" xml:id="jqadiaries-v27-1809-01-27"> <head>27 January 1809</head> <bibl><author>JQA</author><date type="creation" when="1809-01-27"/><editor role="transcription">Neal Millikan</editor></bibl> <div type="docbody"> <p><date>27. </date>About 6. this morning I left Brookfield— Breakfasted at Palmer. Dined at Suffield in Connecticut, and arrived at Hartford at Sun-Set. I had a fellow-traveller as far as Springfield. 28 miles; and the remainder of the way was alone. On arriving at Hartford I found that I had been misinformed at Boston, as to the time taken by this line of Stages, to reach New-York— They had told me, that I should be but two days from Hartford to New-York; and it was upon this Statement that I postponed the day of my departure untill yesterday, from the day before— But at Hartford I learnt, that the Stage would take the whole day to-morrow to reach New-Haven— That the next day being Sunday, it would not go from New-Haven at all— And that leaving that place on Monday, it would go only to Rye on that day, and arrive at New-York about noon on Tuesday— This would delay me so much as to make it doubtful whether I could reach Washington, by the fourth or even the fifth of February, when at the latest I ought to be there— I determined therefore to proceed this Evening to New-Haven, and overtake the Stage, which goes to-morrow morning from that place— By giving an extra-price to the proprietor of the line, I prevailed upon him to send me on accordingly—left Hartford between 6 and 7. this Evening; and traveling through Farmington and Southington, arrived</p> </div> </div> <div type="entry" xml:id="jqadiaries-v27-1809-01-28"> <head>28 January 1809</head> <bibl><author>JQA</author><date type="creation" when="1809-01-28"/><editor role="transcription">Neal Millikan</editor></bibl> <div type="docbody"> <p><date>28. </date>about 2 O’Clock in the morning at New-Haven— I went immediately to bed, and at 6. O’Clock rose again, and proceeded in the Stage—with four fellow-travellers— Breakfasted at Milford— Dined at Norwalk, and about 6. in the Evening arrived at Rye, where we are to lodge this Night— The Sleighing as far as New-Haven was very good— Through the western parts of Massachusetts, and to Hartford, the Snow was nearly three feet deep. From New-Haven, we came in carriages on wheels; though there was snow enough for travelling in Sleighs— The roads are better than I ever knew them— I have been known by my fellow-travellers, the greatest part of this day.— And mark’d, more than was agreeable to me.</p> </div> </div> <div type="entry" xml:id="jqadiaries-v27-1809-01-29"> <head>29 January 1809</head> <bibl><author>JQA</author><date type="creation" when="1809-01-29"/><editor role="transcription">Neal Millikan</editor></bibl> <div type="docbody"> <p><date>29. </date>About 7. this morning we left <persRef ref="penfield-nathaniel">Penfield’s</persRef> inn at Rye.
