At the top and bottom and on the two sides of the Coffin were large Candlesticks four or five feet high, covered with black crape, and having in them wax-tapers of a proportionable size&#8212; About two feet distant at the foot of the Coffin stood a Pope or Priest, with a stand before him on which was a book, chanting in a very low, solemn and plaintive tone in the Russian Language, something which I could not understand&#8212; On one side of the Hall, sat a row of perhaps twenty women in mourning attire&#8212; On the other, were seated several Priests, apparently by their dress of higher rank than the officiating Pope; two of whom wore the decoration of the red ribbon&#8212; There were also several empty chairs, in one of which I seated myself by M<hi rend=\"superscript\">r:</hi> Glukoff&#8217;s invitation&#8212; The Hall was nearly full of other company standing&#8212; The Priest continued his low chant, nearly half an hour&#8212; Then appeared the <persRef ref=\"podobedov-amvrosy\">Metropolitan</persRef>, who took his stand at the same spot, and delivered to each of the other Priests a lighted taper to hold, and each of them kiss&#8217;d his hand on receiving it from him&#8212; They then ranged themselves round the Coffin; lighted tapers were given to every person in company, and the Metropolitan made what I took to be a short prayer&#8212; This concluded the Ceremonies at the house&#8212; The upper cover was then fixed over the Coffin, after the sons and daughters had gone up, and kiss&#8217;d the cheek of the deceased, and the domestics his hand&#8212;the Coffin was carried out; all the Priests followed, and the Company afterwards&#8212; The Corpse was followed by the men of the family, and some of the Priests with lighted tapers, on foot&#8212; The rest followed in Carriages, and the procession went from the Wasily Ostrof, across the bridge, and through the great perspective to the Monastery of <persRef ref=\"nevsky-alexander\">S<hi rend=\"superscript\">t:</hi> Alexander Nefsky</persRef>&#8212; Here in the small chapel near the entrance, we found the corpse again laid in state, and a ceremony commenced which lasted nearly two hours&#8212; The Metropolitan, all the Priests, and a choir of singers officiated at this, which I presume was the celebration of a solemn Mass.&#8212; At the close of this a Carpet was laid, and two benches with Cushions <pb n=\"54\" type=\"ms\"/>placed on it, back of the head of the Coffin&#8212; The Metropolitan, and another of the titled Priests came and sat down on the benches&#8212; The other Priests ranged themselves in rows at the sides of the Coffin&#8212; The Metropolitan again distributed lighted tapers to each of them, and they kiss&#8217;d his hand; lighted tapers were also given to every person attending, and after some further singing a Paper was given to the Metropolitan which he read, and which was then put into the Coffin with the corpse&#8212; It is said to be a recommendation of the deceased to the keeper of Heaven&#8217;s Gates&#8212; A Passport to be presented to <persRef ref=\"peter\">S<hi rend=\"superscript\">t:</hi> Peter</persRef>&#8212; A few drops of some liquor, perhaps consecrated oil, were also poured into the Coffin&#8212; The relations and dependents again went up and kiss&#8217;d the cheek or the hand of the deceased&#8212; The Coffin was again closed with the upper Cover; carried into the grave-yard beside the chapel, and deposited in a grave perhaps eight or nine feet deep&#8212; The persons who attended threw in each a little dust, and a slip of pine branch, with which the chapel, the passage from it to the grave, and to the Street, and all the floors and stairways at the House, were strewed&#8212; On the return of the Metropolitan from the grave numbers of persons well dress&#8217;d, press&#8217;d up to him and kiss&#8217;d his hand as he pass&#8217;d&#8212; M<hi rend=\"superscript\">r:</hi> Glukoff, in renewing his invitation to me to dinner told me that it was a Russian custom&#8212; But having already declined, and trusting to M<hi rend=\"superscript\">r:</hi> Harris&#8217;s information I persisted in declining, and came home with <persRef key=\"smith-william-steuben\">M<hi rend=\"superscript\">r:</hi> Smith</persRef>&#8212; <persRef ref=\"everett-alexander\">M<hi rend=\"superscript\">r:</hi> Everett</persRef> and <persRef ref=\"gray-francis\">M<hi rend=\"superscript\">r:</hi> Gray</persRef> returned to the house; but did not stay to dinner&#8212; They dined with M<hi rend=\"superscript\">r:</hi> Smith at <persRef ref=\"meyer-jc\">M<hi rend=\"superscript\">r:</hi> Meyer&#8217;s</persRef>.

At 7. in the Evening I came home, and went to <persRef ref=\"rumiantsev-nikolai\">Count Romanzoff&#8217;s</persRef>&#8212; I found <persRef ref=\"vonblome-otto\">Baron de Blome</persRef> the Danish Minister with him&#8212; He left the Count&#8217;s Cabinet, as I went into it&#8212; I told the Count that I came at the request of a number of my Countrymen, whose property had been arrested in a very extraordinary manner, by an order of the Danish Government in the Ports of Holstein&#8212; That as to the dispositions of the <persRef ref=\"frederick-vi\">king of Denmark</persRef> with regard to English merchandize or property, that was no concern of mine; but that a great amount of property unquestionably neutral; direct from America, and after having pass&#8217;d through every examination required by the Laws of Denmark had now been arrested under this order&#8212; That purchases to a large amount of the productions of this Country, had been made here and at Riga, on the credit of this property, and the regular payment of which depended upon its speedy liberation&#8212; That as the subject therefore in some sort became interesting to the Government of this Empire, I had requested this interview with him to state the Circumstances to him, and to ask, whether the interposition of the <persRef ref=\"alexander-i\">Emperor&#8217;s</persRef> good offices, with the Danish Government, might not be used, in any manner, whether officially or otherwise in such manner, as to levy this sequester upon American property as speedily <pb n=\"56\" type=\"ms\"/>as possible&#8212; That being aware it was a subject upon which in my character as accredited to this Court, I could make no formal application, I had not thought proper to address to him an official note concerning it&#8212; But relying upon the Emperor&#8217;s good-will towards my Country which he had often manifested, and on the Count&#8217;s own dispositions, which were equally friendly I had flattered myself that by the exertion of his Imperial Majesty&#8217;s influence with the Danish Government, something might be done to obtain the release of this American property and to relieve my Countrymen the owners of it from their distress&#8212; He said that in regard to the Emperor&#8217;s dispositions towards the United States, and as far as he could speak of his own, though infinitely distant from his Imperial Majesty, by his place, they were as friendly as I could believe them to be; and that he personally lamented greatly the distress under which Commerce in general, and with it that of the United States was labouring&#8212; That nothing short of a general Peace, could probably put an end to these embarrassments, and that this general Peace, depended upon England alone&#8212; That he knew not why this general Peace should not be made&#8212; That nothing would be asked of England&#8212;but on the contrary that she would be left in possession of what she had acquired&#8212; That untill she could be reduced to reasonable terms of Peace, it was impossible that Commerce should be free from rigorous restrictions, because it was by operating upon her Commerce, that she must be made to feel her interest in making Peace&#8212; That as to this particular measure of Denmark, it was far from being agreeable to him; and he intimated that it was the subject upon which he had just been conversing with the Baron de Blome&#8212; That he knew, by dispatches from <persRef ref=\"lizakevich-vasily\">M<hi rend=\"superscript\">r:</hi> Lizakewitz</persRef> the Russian Minister at Copenhagen, that the measure had given great dissatisfaction to the Danes themselves&#8212; That there was no occasion to disguise the fact; it was not a voluntary act on the part of the Danish Government&#8212;it had been exacted by France, whose force at their gates, was such as Denmark had no means of resisting; and who considered it as a measure merely of severity against English commerce&#8212; That France had suspected Denmark of conniving at the commerce with England: at least he knew that <persRef ref=\"champagny-jean\">M<hi rend=\"superscript\">r.</hi> Champagny</persRef>, had reproached them with it in very severe terms&#8212; And that in fact, the whole or nearly the whole of that trade, must substantially be viewed as English commerce, since there were now none but English Colonies which produced the articles which went under the denomination of Colonial merchandize&#8212; I assured him, that with the exception perhaps of Coffee, all the articles of colonial trade were produced within the United States&#8212; And that with respect to Coffee, as well as the rest there were all the Spanish islands which produced them in great quantities, besides the English possessions&#8212; But, said he, is not the produce of the United States in these Articles, of inferior quality&#8212; Cotton, for instance&#8212; I told him the United States produced the best of Cotton, and in immense quantities&#8212; That in all the Southern States, as well as in Louisiana the cultivation of this article within the last twenty years had flourished beyond imagination, and that of all the Cotton brought by those American vessels, whose Cargoes had been thus arrested in Holstein, I was persuaded the nine tenths at least was the genuine produce of the United States themselves&#8212; That considerable quantities of sugar were also produced in Louisiana, and in Georgia; which doubtless constituted a great proportion of those Cargoes, and that the rest was probably the produce of the Spanish islands&#8212; Certainly very little if any came from the British Colonies&#8212; As to the Spanish Islands, he said they could now not easily be distinguished from the British, as they had declared themselves for the party of the Junta, <pb n=\"57\" type=\"ms\"/>which in a very extraordinary manner had formally declared War against Denmark&#8212; I remarked that if in consequence of this Declaration of War, the Danish Government thought proper to prohibit the importation for the future of articles, the produce of the Spanish Colonies it was a measure of expediency which they were free to take, but that it could never warrant the seizure of goods already imported under the sanction of the Danish laws; which had pass&#8217;d through every examination required by them, and had received the pledge of protection due from the government of every civilized nation to private property&#8212; That if this was a <hi rend=\"italic\">French</hi> measure, of which the Government of Denmark was only the passive instrument, I trusted that the influence of a Sovereign so powerful, as the Emperor of Russia, and in relations of friendship so close with France, would not be exerted without effect at Paris, and it would be immaterial to us where the means should be used, if they produced the result of doing Justice to us, and restoring to my countrymen their property&#8212; The conduct of England towards my Country had been such as certainly not to inspire me with any partiality in her favour, and I believed the principle of what was called the continental system, which was to bring England to dispositions for Peace, by distressing her Commerce a very good one; but I was surprized that it was not at this day perceived that measures which destroyed the commerce of all other Nations, instead of reducing, turned altogether to the profit of that of England&#8212; That the <persRef ref=\"bonaparte-napoleon\">Emperor Napoleon&#8217;s</persRef> experiment had now been three years in operation; and that in the midst of the most wasteful expences, the grossest internal mismanagement, the most unfortunate expeditions, and in short every thing that could exasperate the People of England against their own Government, and raise the clamour for Peace; no such clamour was heard; and the commerce of the Country, far from being diminished, was flourishing beyond all example&#8212; As a proof of which I referred him to the address from the Corporation of London, to the <persRef ref=\"george-iii\">king</persRef>, on the late Jubilee, and to the king&#8217;s answer&#8212; The Count laughed, and said that as to addresses to kings, and their answers, he believed the best rule was to take all such boastings in an inverted sense&#8212;for, said he, you know when a father of a family, and his family are talking together before the world, they naturally will not speak of their distresses&#8212; I replied that in such a case as this, I believed the conclusion would be more consistent with the fact, by taking the words in their plain and direct sense&#8212; That the flourishing or distress&#8217;d state of commerce was a state of things too notorious by its simplicity, too certain by the practice of reducing it all to precise figures by official returns, to admit of direct falsehoods thus asserted in the face of the world&#8212; That London was a city almost entirely commercial&#8212;that the numerous classes of people subsisting upon commerce, were not accustomed to boast of profit, while they were actually suffering distress; nor even of suffering without loud complaint&#8212; That if at this time any other king in Europe was to receive an address from the principal traders of his kingdom, they would not boast of the flourishing State of their Commerce; nor would the Corporation of London have dared to do so, if the fact had been strikingly the reverse&#8212; It was not however upon this address alone that I relied as evidence of the fact&#8212; Other indications of the same kind, were numerous and decisive&#8212; How indeed could it be otherwise?&#8212; The active commerce of all other Nations, thanks to France, was annihilated&#8212; France herself, Holland, Sweden, Denmark, <pb n=\"58\" type=\"ms\"/>had nothing that could bear the name of Commerce left, in their own ships&#8212; The United States had scarcely any&#8212; Their intercourse with almost all Europe was suspended&#8212; Here alone they were still freely admitted, and into those Ports of Holstein, where this violent measure must now break it up again to the foundation&#8212; That the portion of commerce carried on by American vessels in the Russian Ports was small&#8212; The number of the vessels was ascertained, and His Excellency as Minister of Commerce, knew to what it could amount. He also knew how much of the trade was transacted in Russian vessels; and yet, it was not for me to tell him that between England and this Country, the commerce actually carried on was little less than in time of Peace&#8212; That all articles of English growth and manufacture were to be had here, as if the intercourse was unobstructed, and that every article of Russian produce for which England has occasion goes as plentifully to England as ever&#8212; He said the price of these articles in England had recently risen&#8212;from which, I told him a further proof of my position might be derived; for that the rise of prices in England had followed as a consequence upon the rise of prices here, which had been very considerable&#8212; The inference from this last fact was irresistible: for if the trade with England was actually suspended the prices of Russian produce here must have fallen from the accumulation which would have been unavoidable&#8212; The Commerce therefore was carried on&#8212; And by whom?&#8212; it was not to be disguised, principally by the English; who by means, which I should not undertake to account for, did contrive to evade every ordinance and regulation, and the more surely evaded them in proportion as they were more severe&#8212; That I had personally had an opportunity to observe this on my voyage hither&#8212; For in the Danish dominions the trade with England was forbidden upon pain of Death; and yet on going into a port of Norway, I had seen vessels which pass&#8217;d through the British Squadrons as in time of profound Peace, and was informed from unquestionable authority that there were then seven ships, notoriously English, in the port of Bergen, loading with timber for England, upon English account. He said that he agreed with me in the reasoning, but not in the conclusion&#8212; That all Commerce was to be considered as a benefit to both parties&#8212; That he had no faith in the doctrine of balances of trade, or that any commerce could long exist, unless it was profitable on both sides&#8212; That if Commerce therefore suffered, as in the present State of Europe there could be no doubt it did, the greatest commercial nation in the end, must suffer the most&#8212; That although this crisis had already continued longer than was to be wished yet it could not be considered as a time sufficient for effecting the intended result&#8212; That it would be better that the whole commerce of the World, should cease to exist for ten years than to abandon it forever to the controul of England; that the effect of the restrictive system would eventually press hardest upon England; and that <persRef ref=\"pitt-william2\">M<hi rend=\"superscript\">r:</hi> Pitt</persRef>, whose Talents as a Minister must be acknowledged to have been great, was compelled by the clamours of the English Nation, arising from the distress upon their Commerce to make Peace&#8212; That, I admitted was true; but was imputable to a system of measures in relation to commerce directly opposite to the present&#8212; A system, which encouraged and favoured the trade of the Nations which were the rivals of England, so that the English could not support a competition with them&#8212; And although the English Commerce, might partially suffer in the general mass with the rest, it was much more than indemnified by the part which it had acquired, <pb n=\"59\" type=\"ms\"/>from the ruins of all the other commercial Nations&#8212; The Count asked me if I had read a late publication of <persRef ref=\"divernois-francis\">M<hi rend=\"superscript\">r:</hi> d&#8217;Ivernois</persRef> on this subject&#8212; I had heard of the Book, but not seen it&#8212; He said its representations corresponded much with the ideas I had expressed; but that he had only taken the State of Ireland, to prove his position&#8212; This was not very conclusive; for the commerce of Ireland formed a very small part of that of the United Kingdom; and the great stress laid upon the alledged prosperity of this particular branch of the trade, raised a strong presumption that the actual state of the whole was distress&#8217;d&#8212; He concluded by saying that on the subject of my request he would take the orders of the Emperor, and inform me of the result, but that as this was a measure emanating from the personal disposition of the Emperor of France, he was apprehensive there existed no influence in the world of sufficient efficacy to shake his determination&#8212; The general impression upon my mind was that the Count himself was fully persuaded of the truth of my representations, and that he really disapproved of these measures; but that Russia would not interfere in the case&#8212; He told me that immediately after the return of the Emperor, <persRef ref=\"vonderpahlen-friedrich\">Count Pahlen&#8217;s</persRef> Secretary would be dispatched to Paris, with his final instructions, and orders that he should immediately proceed to America&#8212; He supposed he would have no difficulty in finding an opportunity to go&#8212;of which however, in the present State of our Commerce, I intimated some doubts&#8212; He said he would send me word, before <persRef ref=\"u\">M<hi rend=\"superscript\">r:</hi> Ivanoff</persRef> should go, that if we pleased we might take the opportunity to write by him&#8212; I left the Count about 9. in the Evening, and pass&#8217;d the remainder of it at home&#8212; <persRef ref=\"u\">D<hi rend=\"superscript\">r:</hi> Galloway</persRef> was here to see <persRef key=\"smith-catherine-johnson\">Catherine</persRef>, who is very unwell, and confined to her chamber.</p> </div> </div> <div type=\"entry\" xml:id=\"jqadiaries-v28-1809-12-27\"> <head>27 December 1809</head> <bibl><author>JQA</author><date type=\"creation\" when=\"1809-12-27\"/><editor role=\"transcription\">Neal Millikan</editor></bibl> <div type=\"docbody\"> <p><date>27. </date>This morning I called upon <persRef ref=\"einsiedel-george\">Count Einsiedel</persRef>, and looked over his apartments, and his furniture, which he is about to leave, and which I purpose taking, if possible&#8212;

The Company were to meet at noon, and pass the day and Evening there&#8212; <persRef key=\"adams-louisa-catherine\">M<hi rend=\"superscript\">rs:</hi> Adams</persRef> and Catherine being unwell, could not go&#8212; Just as I was on the point of setting out, I received a note from <persRef ref=\"rumiantsev-nikolai\">Count Romanzoff</persRef>, requesting me to call upon him at 2. O&#8217;Clock, I was therefore obliged to postpone my ride to the Ice-hills, untill three. <pb n=\"60\" type=\"ms\"/>At two O&#8217;Clock I called upon Count Romanzoff, who told me, that yesterday, being the first day since the <persRef ref=\"alexander-i\">Emperor&#8217;s</persRef> return, that he had transacted business with him, he had reported to his Majesty, my application to him, requesting the interposition of his good offices, with the Danish Government, for the restoration as speedily as possible of the property of Americans sequestered in the Ports of Holstein&#8212; That he had informed His Majesty of the answer, which in his official character he had thought it his duty to give me, and to lead me to expect; leaving the decision free to him, conformably to his own inclinations&#8212; That the Emperor had judged differently upon the subject from him&#8212; He had ordered him immediately to represent to the Danish Government his wish that the examination might be expedited and the American property restored as soon as possible; which order he had already executed&#8212; He had sent this morning for the <persRef ref=\"vonblome-otto\">Baron de Blome</persRef>, and had requested him to transmit to his Court these sentiments of the Emperor, with the assurance that His Majesty took great interest in obtaining a compliance with them&#8212; That the Emperor was gratified at this opportunity of proving his friendly dispositions towards the United States; perhaps the interest of his own subjects might justify his interference on the occasion; this was what he had not thought it necessary to examine; it was sufficient for him that it would manifest his regard for the interests of the United States&#8212; I assured the Count that I should inform my Government of this fresh instance of the Emperor&#8217;s benevolence, and that I could answer before hand for the grateful acknowledgments which it would produce.&#8212; That I was the more agreeably surprized at this determination, as from the last conversation I had had with his Excellency, I had been apprehensive of a different result&#8212; That on leaving him before, I had felt obliged to him for the frank and candid manner in which he had spoken in relation to the object of my application, which I preferred infinitely to a more flattering manner, which might have led to hopes that would be disappointed&#8212; But that having entertained little or no hopes of success, from his manner of considering the subject, at that time, I was now the more delighted at finding that my countrymen would have the benefit of his Majesty&#8217;s powerful intercession&#8212; The Count said that he wished by this course of proceeding to deserve my Confidence&#8212; I observed to him, that for this purpose it was unnecessary, as my confidence in his Dispositions was already as strong as possible&#8212; He desired me to mention to Baron Blome, when I should have the opportunity to see him, that he had told me this determination of the Emperor, and of the Count&#8217;s interview with him respecting it&#8212; He said that Baron Blome, had repeated to him, what he had said to me, that it was a measure to which Denmark had been impelled by France, and which she had taken with reluctance&#8212; I enquired how the Emperor found his health since his tour to Moscow&#8212; He said well&#8212;and that he had been delighted with the marks of attachment which he had received from the People there&#8212; That he would probably repeat his visits there occasionally; for he had said to him yesterday it was an excellent idea, he had had of establishing his Sister <persRef ref=\"catherinepavlovna\">Catherine</persRef> at Twer; for when I have a mind to go to Moscow, I have only to take her in my pocket, and can go there without any of the expense and parade of an Imperial Journey; as might be necessary said the Count, for a journey with the <persRef ref=\"elizabeth-alexeievna\">Empress</persRef>, or <persRef ref=\"mariafeodorovna\">Empress mother</persRef>&#8212; He said the Emperor had charmed the People of Moscow, by riding in an open sleigh, according to the custom of the Country; and by going round and observing all the quarters of the City which he knew as if he had been bred <pb n=\"61\" type=\"ms\"/>there&#8212;and that the People had received him with more proofs of joy, and attachment to his person than they had given at his coronation&#8212; I left the Count after an interview of about half an hour, and then went with M<hi rend=\"superscript\">r:</hi> Smith to the French Ambassador&#8217;s Ice-Hills at Kammenoi-ostrow&#8212; We got there about half an hour before dinner; just in time to see a little of the sliding down the hills, and taking part in the amusement&#8212; There was a company of about fifty persons, the Ambassador&#8217;s usual company&#8212; Most of them specially equip&#8217;d for the purpose&#8212; The men with fur-lined Spencer&#8217;s and caps, pantaloons over boots, fur-caps, and thick leather mittens&#8212; The ladies with fur lined riding-habits&#8212; About 4. O&#8217;Clock, dinner was served, and lasted about an hour&#8212; In the Evening the ice-hills were lighted with lamps and torches, and some of the company went out again; but did not stay long&#8212; The cold which had been all day very severe, towards Evening increased to 15 degrees below Fahrenheit&#8217;s 0. it moderated however before midnight&#8212; In the house cards, dice, and dancing employed those who delight in such Sports&#8212; I came home with M<hi rend=\"superscript\">r:</hi> Smith before 9 at Night, to spare the Servants the severity of the weather&#8212; <persRef ref=\"nelson\">Nelson</persRef> however got his toes frozen&#8212; I saw Baron Blome at the Ice-hills, and had a long conversation with him on the detention of the American property, in Holstein&#8212; He told me again that it was a measure to which they had been goaded by France&#8212; That it was more injurious to themselves than to us&#8212;that this little trade in American vessels, which had given them an opportunity of laying a transit duty, was the only source of revenue left them&#8212; But that in Hamburg they had been jealous of it, and had written to Paris that the Danes were carrying on a contraband trade with the English&#8212; Upon this France had loaded them with bitter reproaches, which were altogether unmerited&#8212; For Denmark had excluded more rigorously the English trade than any body&#8212; Excepting the outskirts of the kingdom in Norway, over which it was impossible for the government to have an effectual controul; the exclusion of English trade, had been complete&#8212; Denmark had sacrificed herself for the common Cause, and instead of acknowledgment, this was the return she received&#8212; I took this opportunity to repeat to Baron Blome the ideas which I had suggested the other day to Count Romanzoff, respecting the Continental system, and the <persRef ref=\"bonaparte-napoleon\">Emperor Napoleon&#8217;s</persRef> idea of carrying it into effect&#8212; I told him that it was impossible for a human heart to feel a stronger abhorrence, than I had of the proceedings of the British Government towards Denmark&#8212; That I knew and felt for the situation of Denmark&#8212; That in point of principle, and of real interests, those of Denmark and of the United States were precisely the same&#8212; That I hoped the day would soon come, when they might freely pursue those interests, without reproach from any quarter&#8212; That if the present course of measures was merely personal to the Emperor Napoleon, he must soon perceive, as blindness itself could not but now perceive, that Britain was profiting by the commercial losses of all his friends&#8212; That his measures had now been three years in operation&#8212; That all other commerce was ruined; while in England it was more prosperous than ever&#8212; That the duties on imports had exceeded nearly by two millions those of any preceding year&#8212; That no clamours, no Petitions for Peace, were heard of among the English People&#8212; That if on the field of Battle, the Emperor Napoleon, should see his army on the brink of destruction, and <pb n=\"62\" type=\"ms\"/>his enemy almost in possession of the victory, by an error which it was still in his power to repair, and to secure the day, he was too good a general to sacrifice himself and his troops, to a proud perseverance in mistaken measures&#8212; That as a Statesman, to persist obstinately, or from the petty vanity of never acknowledging error, in a course, which in its effects was altogether advantageous to his enemy, and to resist the evidence of demonstration itself, argued a weakness of character, which I hoped he would dread more than to retract a false step&#8212; That in the estimation of effects, he as well as others must calculate the extent of human power, and that with such a surface as the Continent of Europe, under the stimulous of mutual superfluities and wants, commerce could not be destroyed&#8212; That in the condition of Spain, the very idea of excluding British Commerce from the Continent, by <hi rend=\"italic\">prohibitions</hi>, was like an attempt to exclude the air from a bottle, by sealing up hermetically the mouth, while there was a great hole in the side&#8212; The Baron expressed himself perfectly convinced of the accuracy of these remarks, and wished that the Emperor of France, might soon open his eyes to conviction&#8212; He appeared to take in good part what I said, and promised to transmit to his government the claim of <persRef ref=\"williams-cumberland\">M<hi rend=\"superscript\">r:</hi> Williams</persRef>, which I mentioned to him&#8212;though he said they considered all vessels under British convoy as fair prize&#8212;</p> </div> </div> <div type=\"entry\" xml:id=\"jqadiaries-v28-1809-12-30\"> <head>30 December 1809</head> <bibl><author>JQA</author><date type=\"creation\" when=\"1809-12-30\"/><editor role=\"transcription\">Neal Millikan</editor></bibl> <div type=\"docbody\"> <p><date>30. </date>Visits this morning from <persRef ref=\"dana-francis2\">M<hi rend=\"superscript\">r:</hi> Dana</persRef>, and <persRef ref=\"coffin-thomas\">M<hi rend=\"superscript\">r:</hi> Coffin</persRef> who have just arrived from Archangel&#8212;
