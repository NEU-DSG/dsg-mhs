						<p>Twelve months have nearly elapsed, since I discontinued this journal
							altogether. Several months of ill health detained me at Braintree, and
							wholly disqualified me for the use of the pen; after attending the
							Session of the supreme judicial Court at Boston in February, I return’d
							to this Town, on the 26<hi rend="superscript">th:</hi> day of March,
							since which my health has been gradually restored; and is now almost as
							good as it was previous to my sickness. The events which have occurred
							since, I have omitted to record them, have not been sufficiently
							interesting to induce me to regret the loss; but as those which are now
							immediately before me, may be more important, I shall for a few weeks at
							least resume the practice, which sickness at first, and indolence
							afterwards led me to disuse.</p>

								ref="u">Lanman</persRef> this morning, and went to the College,
							which consists only of one building, nearly as long as two of the halls
							at Cambridge. This being a time of vacation, the tutors were absent from
							the College; so that we had not an opportunity of seeing the library,
							which however is very small. The chambers are not, I think so well
							arranged; they are certainly not so decent as those at Cambridge.—
								<persRef ref="brown-john4">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> John
								Brown’s</persRef> house is likewise a very conspicuous building. We
							only saw the outside of it; which is the most magnificent and elegant
							private mansion, that I have ever seen on this continent. The Baptist
							church in this town, is said to be the handsomest house of public
							worship in America, and there are a large number of very good private
							houses; the streets appear to be busy; and every thing exhibits
							evidence, that this is a flourishing and a thriving town. But the people
							appear much aggrieved by the proceedings of their government; who for
							several years past have given the sanction of law, to every species of
							iniquity. Their supreme judicial Court are now in Session at Providence.
							I went into Court, twice this forenoon; they were doing nothing: and the
							appearance of the Judges, was a perfect burlesque upon justice.— At
							about twelve o’clock we went on board the packet <hi rend="italic"
								>Leopard</hi>, <hi rend="italic">having</hi>
							<pb n="238" type="ms"/>having for fellow travellers, besides the two
							gentlemen with whom I came from Boston, a <persRef ref="u">M<hi

							Newport, whom I formerly saw at the Hague, <hi rend="italic">and </hi>a
							number of women, who appear habituated to move in humble stations of
							life: there was a man with them, who entertained us very highly with
							singing. He had an inexhaustible fund of songs; but in the whole
							collection there was not one that I ever heard sung before; nor one that
							was tolerably good. Vulgarity and nonsense were completely united in
							every one of them.— The distance between Providence and Newport is about
							30 miles. The usual passage is from five to six hours; but we sailed in
							a calm; and after being carried down by the tide, and the trifling
							breezes which arose, about half the way; we were obliged to come to
							anchor in order to avoid drifting backward, by means of the tide, which
							had turned against us. We continued at anchor from 7 in the evening to
							1. in the morning, and then again took advantage of the tide, and of a
							small favourable breeze which came up. The cabin was small; the
							accommodations not sufficient for the number of passengers, and the beds
							very indifferent. From a mixture therefore of choice and necessity, I
							walk’d on deck a great part of the night; and had <hi rend="italic"

							10,000 inhabitants; they are now reduced to 7000. Its former prosperity,
							was chiefly owing to its extensive employment in the african slave
							trade, of which some remnants still continue to support it. The town is
							large, but many of the houses, and the most elegant of them are
							altogether out of repair; and for want of painting make a dismal
							appearance; the streets are dull, and the wharves appear more frequented
							by idlers than by men of business. We had fine weather but little wind,

							in the galleries of the house. The principal debate was upon the
							salaries of the Judges. The subject was not very interesting; but like
							almost every other subject exhibited the difficulty of adjusting the
							opposing sentiments which direct the conduct of men living in different

							he determined to bring the remainder, amounting to about £6000 sterling,
							and settle in some part of America.— <persRef ref="morris-thomas">M<hi
