      <p>I came here my dear Robert last Monday, and find it no small item in my pleasures that I am nearer to you -- -- Your letter reached me on <del>Friday</del> <add>Thursday</add> Morning before <persRef ref="sedgwick-charles">Charles’</persRef> departure, and contained enough to make him go rejoicing <del>s</del><del>t</del> on his way, from the delightful proof that the way he had chosen is approved by you my dear Robert --</p>

      <p>He is at the height of happiness -- with enough of certainty to make him independent of hope and yet all his future brightened with her with her glad gay coloring -- Care will come with its corrosion and disappointment with its blight, for they come to all. But Charles has an exhaustless source of contentment in his own bosom -- We have a right to expect that the blessing of his God, and the God of his Fathers will follow him -- -- If he has not what the world can give, he has what it cannot give or take away -- -- He left us Thursday Morning and proceeded to Northampton on Friday. I presume he will return to S tomorrow -- -- <persRef ref="sedgwick-elizabeth">Eliz’</persRef> seems fully aware of the distinction which Charles' preference confers upon her -- -- Love true Love seems to me to be a notable Teacher of Humility -- -- Eliz’ poor Child seems to think her fate deserves the ‘all Hail’, but she wears her honors with all the graces of humble-mindedness --</p>

      <p>I long to hear from you, now that you know the matter is settled, and from <persRef ref="sedgwick-henry">Harry</persRef> and <persRef ref="sedgwick-jane">Jane</persRef> -- Charles is exceedingly anxious to know how Harry is affected towards it -- -- -- He has had great fear of both <pb n="2"/> Harry &amp; <persRef ref="sedgwick-theodore2">Theodore</persRef> -- -- He said he would take ‘the steps’ with Theodore if he looked dark upon him because it was folly for a Man to profess to be a Beleiver, and exercise no faith -- Harry is such a Heretic that I don’t know what he will do with him -- However I trust that Jeanie’s sentiment and his own most kind and excellent feelings will triumph over his worldly-mindedness -- </p>

      <p>I want very much to hear Jane talk about it -- Eliz’ has intended visiting N-York in the Spring -- To pay a visit to her friend <persRef ref="woolsey-unknown">Miss Woolsey</persRef> -- -- Now she has <del><unclear/></del> Connections there, more interesting to her, her desire to go will-not probably be diminished -- By the way, since I came here, I have heard that it has been positively asserted by some knowing Gossips who know all about everything that you are engaged to Miss Woolsey!!</p>

      <p>I can’t imagine what <persRef ref="unknown-edward">Edward</persRef> meant. My <del>letter</del> last letter, was such as his last to me authorized, half raillery, &amp; half-serious -- He perhaps may have shown it to <persRef ref="U">F</persRef> and thus committed himself -- </p>

      <p><persRef ref="dwight-henry">Henry</persRef> said that the talk of M<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> C’ -- attentions to Miss D. had quite subsided before he left Boston -- -- I thought it very probable the affair had issued unfortunately for E -- and I must think the young Lady stands very much in her own light <ptr type="fn" n="1" target="CMS1819-03-08-toRobertSedgwickIF-fn1"/> -- -- Jane thinks Edward has no heart -- I do not think so -- It may not have been much in exercise, for their domestic relations have not been hallowed by the cultivation of their affections -- I believe the root of the matter is in him and it will finally produce its fruit provided it is not chilled by the solitude of a Bachelor’s life -- <pb n="3"/> </p>

      <p><persRef ref="warner-thomas">Thomas Warner </persRef>is here -- and I beleive seriously anxious to close his concerns in the usual way -- but poor <persRef ref="payne-eloise">Eloise</persRef> is quite sick, <del><unclear/></del> with a violent cold, which has attacked her lung -- <persRef ref="james-unknown">Doctor James</persRef> -- sayes she is doing well and will probably be out again in a few days -- -- T’s plan as I hear is to take a farm in the vicinity of your City -- Were there ever two persons less qualified for the <add>vulgar</add> concerns of rural economy? Eloise says she is to be the ‘Maiden all forlorn’ and ‘milk the cow with a crumpled horn’ <ptr type="fn" n="2" target="CMS1819-03-08-toRobertSedgwickIF-fn2"/> -- -- We are daily hoping to hear the fate of <persRef ref="osborne-john">Doctor Osborne</persRef> -- Poor <gap/> <persRef ref="caldwell-charlotte">Charlotte Caldwell</persRef> has fallen a victim to the Consumption <gap/> She died Saturday night -- -- We are told that after suffering the most horrible conflict -- she became resigned and happy -- -- The transition from her gay and trifling life to the sublime realities of Death and the Judgment to come <del>has</del> is appalling -- -- and nothing but the strength that is perfected in weakness, could sustain the soul -- --</p>

      <p>I have been delightfully interrupted by your letter by D<hi rend="superscript">r</hi> James -- You feel just as I thought you would -- -- and I am <hi rend="underline">delighted perfectly delighted</hi> that Harry and Jane join in the warm and full expression of felicitation -- Charles will now be perfectly satisfied -- He loves all his family so much that he could not have been happy if they were not -- -- Charles will write <persRef ref="brush-unknown">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Brush</persRef> -- It will be the best way of breaking the fall I find she anticipates it from her last letter to me -- and speaks of it in a manner that does credit to her understanding, &amp; great honor to her heart -- <persRef ref="sedgwick-susan">Susan</persRef>, <persRef ref="symmes-susannah">M<hi rend="superscript">rs</hi> Symmes </persRef> and all send Love -- Mine to all -- Beleive me dearest Brother </p>

Both Robert and Harry Sedgwick courted women from this group. As Timothy Kenslea notes in <hi rend="italic">The </hi><hi rend="italic">Sedgwicks</hi><hi rend="italic"> in Love</hi>, the difficulty of identifying individual friendlies is "compounded by the brothers' unwillingness to write out the ladies' first names, and usually their last names as well.
