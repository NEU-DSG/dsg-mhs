I had not forgotten it, but I wished to get the thorough good will of everybody without arousing any opposition before we touched such a sore point. You see we must win ardent believers in us in order to get our wares fairly tested. I am often accused by <persRef ref="richards-robert">my husband</persRef> of being very deep in my plans and of not always telling at once what they are. So in this case I stipulated that at first only such things should be made as could not be got elsewhere</p> <p> Again our women must be <pb n="2"/> trained so that they will be exact &amp; careful in their work without too constant supervision. I was afraid you would become impatient but I see quite as much progress as I expected during the first two months. Matters will move more rapidly now. <persRef ref="abel-mary">Mrs Abel</persRef> is winning the confidence of people so that we shall have no difficulty in introducing our wares. There will be a great field for our ovens in Hospital work, already several openings are showing. Just as soon as we can do without our range for heating we will fit up for summer cooking with all that you can suggest.</p> <closer> Very truly<lb/> <signed>Ellen H.
