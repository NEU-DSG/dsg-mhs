I thank’d him for the confidence, which was indicated by this proposal, and enquired what the particular objects of negotiation would be; and at what time I should be required or expected to go— He said that there would be no particular immediate subject of negotiation, unless it should appear that commercial arrangements of mutual benefit might be made— But that if a negotiation <pb n="391" type="ms"/>negotiation for Peace should ensue, and the principles of maritime rights become objects of the Treaty, the interests of <placeName type="nerHelper-added">the United States</placeName> might require their participation— That at least it might be necessary to guard against any possible combination of the two powers at War against us, and that the cultivation of the Emperor of Russia’s friendship might in this respect be very important— He said that copies of M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Short’s instructions would be furnished me, and such further instructions as might occur as necessary— That as to the time of my departure, it might be, as soon as my convenience would admit—probably not under a month and perhaps more— The Salary and allowances would be those usual to Ministers of the same rank— I enquired what length of time the mission would probably continue— He said that was indefinite, and might depend upon Events— Perhaps three or four years— I told him that upon the little consideration I was able to give the subject upon this sudden notice, I could see no sufficient reason for refusing the nomination; though from the circumstances, the confirmation by the Senate might be uncertain— He again apologized for the shortness of the time, and said that if upon further consideration I should perceive any insuperable obstacle to my acceptance, on the confirmation of the appointment, I might still reserve the right of finally declining. On these grounds I consented that the nomination should be made.— I called to visit <persRef ref="cushing-hannah">M<hi rend="superscript">rs:</hi> Cushing</persRef> with <persRef ref="pope-eliza">Eliza</persRef> and <persRef key="hellen-adelaide">Adelaide Johnson</persRef>, and afterwards pass’d the day in attendance upon the Court— The Report of the nominations was circulated round within an hour of the time when I went into Court— An important Cause of the Assignees of <persRef ref="bird-robert">Robert Bird</persRef> was partly argued— When I got home I found all the nominations known there also.— That of <persRef ref="smith-robert">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> R.

O’Clock, the boy came and broke up their game, by calling for the table to lay the Cloth for Breakfast.— In coming down the river from Baltimore, we saw a number of light vessels loading for sea, and several ready to sail— This being the day, on which the Embargo ceases throughout the United States— There was great stir and appearance of active business on the river, and at the wharves.</p> </div> </div> <div type="entry" xml:id="jqadiaries-v27-1809-03-17"> <head>17 March 1809</head> <bibl><author>JQA</author><date type="creation" when="1809-03-17"/><editor role="transcription">Neal Millikan</editor></bibl> <div type="docbody"> <p><date>17. </date>About 8. this morning we landed at Cecil-point, and immediately took Stages for Newcastle.

After reading my lecture I returned to Boston— Judge Davis at 5 O’Clock came, and took the deposition of <persRef ref="head-joseph3">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Head</persRef>— <persRef ref="amory-rufus">M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> R. G. Amory</persRef> attended as Counsel for <persRef ref="amory-thomas">his brother</persRef>— We were engaged untill past 9 in the Evening in taking the deposition— Judge Davis took it home with him, to draw the caption and certificate; to have in readiness to-morrow morning— But after I came home, M<hi rend="superscript">r:</hi> Head came and told me that he wished to give some additional testimony to-morrow morning, to explain part of his deposition this Evening— I agreed therefore to meet him at the judge’s house at 9 1/2 to-morrow morning.</p> </div> </div> <div type="entry" xml:id="jqadiaries-v27-1809-03-xx"> <head>Day</head> <bibl><author>JQA</author><date type="creation" when="1809-03"/><editor role="transcription">Neal Millikan</editor></bibl> <div type="docbody"> <p><date><hi rend="italic">Day</hi>—</date> The first half of the month like that which preceded it— The next ten days, traveling from Washington— The last week quite unsettled— It would be my wish, and if I could make resolutions, would be my determination, to fix upon some <hi rend="italic">one</hi> object of application to which I should devote all my leisure time— But I fear nothing less than a necessity of external causes can overcome the indolence of my nature, and the instinctive horror of long and systematic pursuit of one purpose— This is one of the most essential defects in my character.</p> </div> </div> </div> </body> </text> </TEI>
