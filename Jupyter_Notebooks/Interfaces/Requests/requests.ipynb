This being a time of vacation, the tutors were absent from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe College; so that we had not an opportunity of seeing the library,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twhich however is very small. The chambers are not, I think so well\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tarranged; they are certainly not so decent as those at Cambridge.\\xe2\\x80\\x94\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<persRef ref=\"brown-john4\">M<hi rend=\"superscript\">r:</hi> John\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tBrown\\xe2\\x80\\x99s</persRef> house is likewise a very conspicuous building. We\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tonly saw the outside of it; which is the most magnificent and elegant\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tprivate mansion, that I have ever seen on this continent. The Baptist\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tchurch in this town, is said to be the handsomest house of public\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tworship in America, and there are a large number of very good private\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thouses; the streets appear to be busy; and every thing exhibits\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tevidence, that this is a flourishing and a thriving town. But the people\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tappear much aggrieved by the proceedings of their government; who for\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tseveral years past have given the sanction of law, to every species of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tiniquity. Their supreme judicial Court are now in Session at Providence.\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tI went into Court, twice this forenoon; they were doing nothing: and the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tappearance of the Judges, was a perfect burlesque upon justice.\\xe2\\x80\\x94 At\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tabout twelve o\\xe2\\x80\\x99clock we went on board the packet <hi rend=\"italic\">Leopard</hi>, <hi rend=\"italic\">having</hi>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<pb n=\"238\" type=\"ms\"/>having for fellow travellers, besides the two\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tgentlemen with whom I came from Boston, a <persRef ref=\"u\">M<hi rend=\"superscript\">r:</hi> Goldthwait</persRef>, a merchant of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tNewport, whom I formerly saw at the Hague, <hi rend=\"italic\">and </hi>a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tnumber of women, who appear habituated to move in humble stations of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlife: there was a man with them, who entertained us very highly with\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsinging. He had an inexhaustible fund of songs; but in the whole\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcollection there was not one that I ever heard sung before; nor one that\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twas tolerably good. Vulgarity and nonsense were completely united in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tevery one of them.\\xe2\\x80\\x94 The distance between Providence and Newport is about\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t30 miles. The usual passage is from five to six hours; but we sailed in\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ta calm; and after being carried down by the tide, and the trifling\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbreezes which arose, about half the way; we were obliged to come to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tanchor in order to avoid drifting backward, by means of the tide, which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thad turned against us. We continued at anchor from 7 in the evening to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t1. in the morning, and then again took advantage of the tide, and of a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tsmall favourable breeze which came up. The cabin was small; the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\taccommodations not sufficient for the number of passengers, and the beds\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tvery indifferent. From a mixture therefore of choice and necessity, I\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twalk\\xe2\\x80\\x99d on deck a great part of the night; and had <hi rend=\"italic\">not</hi>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<pb n=\"239\" type=\"ms\"/>not slept an hour, when at 6 in the morning, we\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tarrived at Newport.</p>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t</div>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t<div type=\"entry\" xml:id=\"jqadiaries-v12-1789-09-10\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<head>10 September 1789</head>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<bibl>\\n            <author>JQA</author>\\n            <date type=\"creation\" when=\"1789-09-10\"/>\\n            <editor role=\"transcription\">Neal Millikan</editor>\\n          </bibl>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<div type=\"docbody\">\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<p>\\n              <date>10<hi rend=\"superscript\">th:</hi>\\n              </date> We put up at <persRef ref=\"u\">Townsend\\xe2\\x80\\x99s</persRef> tavern, being near the wharf from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twhence the New-York packets sail.

The city of Newport appears to advantage from\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthis river; but in itself it exhibits a melancholy picture of declining\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcommerce and population.

Its former prosperity,\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\twas chiefly owing to its extensive employment in the african slave\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttrade, of which some remnants still continue to support it. The town is\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tlarge, but many of the houses, and the most elegant of them are\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\taltogether out of repair; and for want of painting make a dismal\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tappearance; the streets are dull, and the wharves appear more frequented\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tby idlers than by men of business.

The tide had just turned\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tin our favour, so that we lost nothing by anchoring last night: for no\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tvessel pretends to <hi rend=\"italic\">pass</hi>\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t<pb n=\"245\" type=\"ms\"/>pass this dangerous place against the tide, nor\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tin the night. As we came through just at high tide, we saw nothing\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tpeculiar, except an irregularity in the running of the water; but at low\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ttide, we were informed there are several eddies and whirlpools, which\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\thave a formidable appearance. There have been many instances of vessels\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\toverset at this place, and others of their being whirl\\xe2\\x80\\x99d round by the\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tviolence of the eddy. The name itself of the place is sufficiently\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tindicative of the dangers which sailors have apprehended from it. From\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthis place to the city of New-York, the distance is about eight miles;\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\ton one side<hi rend=\"strikethrough\">s</hi> of the river there are a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tnumber of islands pleasantly situated; and on the other; a number of\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tbeautiful country seats, which <hi rend=\"strikethrough\">enj</hi> have a\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tcharming prospect upon the river, and afford one no less agreeable to\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tthe traveller upon it.
