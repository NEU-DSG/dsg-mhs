          <p><date>1 V:15.</date> Tuesday. W. A. Schoolfield at the Office. About Slaves. Weekly
            tea-party resumed. I send you a list of the stockholders of the Bank of the U. States –
            foreign and domestic and am very sorry that I <unclear cert="low">suffered</unclear> the
            promise I made to you in Baltimore to escape from my mind until it was brought back by
            your letter – my apology is the pressure of many engagements – and I hope the delay has
            not produced inconvenience. I am often accused by <persRef ref="richards-robert">my
              husband</persRef> of being very deep in my plans and of not always telling at once
            what they are. <persRef ref="abel-mary">Mrs Abel</persRef> is winning the confidence of
            people so that we shall have no difficulty in introducing our wares.</p>

          <p>Another paragraph here that discusses the daily errands of W. A. Schoolfield.
            Schoolfield's work was in Baltimore.</p>
